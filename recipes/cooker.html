    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Slow cooked, Texas-style pulled pork that is served on a buttered and
      toasted roll. My family's favorite.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (4 pound) pork shoulder roast</li>
      <li>1 cup barbeque sauce</li>
      <li>½ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Description</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour the vegetable oil into the bottom of a slow cooker. Place the pork
        roast into the slow cooker; pour in the barbecue sauce, apple cider
        vinegar, and chicken broth. Stir in the brown sugar, yellow mustard,
        Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, onion, garlic, and thyme. Cover and
        cook on High until the roast shreds easily with a fork, 5 to 6 hours.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove the roast from the slow cooker, and shred the meat using two
        forks. Return the shredded pork to the slow cooker, and stir the meat
        into the juices.
      </li>

      <li>
        Spread the inside of both halves of hamburger buns with butter. Toast
        the buns, butter side down, in a skillet over medium heat until golden
        brown. Spoon pork into the toasted buns.
      </li>
    </ol>
